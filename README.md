In JavaScript, both var and let are used for variable declarations, but they have some key differences:

1. Scope:
   - var is function-scoped, meaning it's a global scope function in which it's declared, even if it's declared within a block like a loop or an if statement.
   - let is block-scoped, meaning it's a blocked scope function in which it's declared, like a loop or an if statement.

2. Hoisting:
   - Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their function or global scope. This means you can use a variable before it's declared, but it will have the value `undefined`.
   - Variables declared with let are also hoisted, but they're not initialized. If you try to access a let variable before its declaration, you'll get a ReferenceError.

3. Re-declaration:
   - You can re-declare a variable using var within the same scope without any errors.
   - With let, re-declaring a variable within the same scope will result in a SyntaxError.


var and const are both used for variable declarations in JavaScript, but they have several key differences:

 const is used for declaring variables that you don't intend to reassign, providing immutability for primitive values, while var is more flexible and has broader scope and mutability. It's generally recommended to use const by default for declaring variables, resorting to let only when you need a variable whose value will change.

 
 The primary difference between var and const in JavaScript lies in their mutability and scope.

 const is used for declaring variables that you don't intend to reassign, providing immutability for primitive values, while var is more flexible and has broader scope and mutability. It's generally recommended to use const by default for declaring variables, resorting to let only when you need a variable whose value will change.


Hoisting.

hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during compilation, allowing you to use them before they're actually declared in the code. However, it's important to understand that only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations or function assignments.
